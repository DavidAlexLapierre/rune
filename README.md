# Rune 🪄

**Rune** is a modular, JSON-based build system tailored for [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/) projects. It lets you define and automate complex builds cleanly and predictably.

## 🔧 Features

- 🔍 **Explicit Build Definitions** – Everything lives in `rune.json` file.
- 🧱 **Multi-profile Support** – Build for multiple architectures easily.
- ⚙️ **Script Hooks** – Add pre/post build behavior with reusable named scripts.
- 📦 **Custom Output Paths & Flags** – Fine-tune builds per profile with full control.

## Installation

To install Rune, you can either download the source code from one of the releases or clone the repository by running ```git clone https://github.com/ametyx/rune.git```. I suggested always picking the latest release since it will have the appropriate version.

Once you have the source code, run the follow command to build the project in your terminal

```sh
# On Windows and from the root directory
./scripts/build.bat

# On Linux/MacOS from the root directory
./scripts/build.sh
```

**Note**: Once it's done, either copy the executable to another directory or leave it as is. After, add the path to the location of the executable to your PATH.

  run [profile?]          Compile and run the executable for a given profile.
                                  If no profile is given, uses the default profile in rune.json.

Project files:
  rune.json                       Defines profiles, default profile, and scripts for the project.

Examples:
  rune new release bin/app        Create a rune.json with a 'release' profile targeting bin/app
  rune test                       Run tests using the default profile
  rune run                        Run the executable using the default profile
```

**✨New**

Create a new rune.json file with the given build mode and output target.

```sh
# Usage
rune new [build-mode] -o:<target>

# Creates an executable called my_project
rune new exe -o:my_project

# Creates a dynamic library with the name of the parent directory
rune new dynamic
```

**🛠️Build**

Compile the project using a given profile. Defaults to the profile specified in `configs.profile`.

```sh
# Usage
rune build [profile?]

# Build the default profile
rune build

# Builds a debug profile
rune build debug

# Builds a release profile
rune build release
```

**🧪Test**

Run tests given a profile with the option of targeting a specific file or a single test. Defaults
to the profile specified in `configs.test_profile`.

```sh
# Usage
rune test [profile?] -t:<test_name> -f:<file_name>

# Run the default test profile
rune test

# Run a specific test profile
rune test my_test_profile

# Test a specific file
rune test -f:./path/to/my/file.odin

# Run a specific test
rune test -t:name_of_my_test_procedure

# Run a specific package
rune test -p:my_package
```

**🚀Run**

Compiles and run a project given a profile. Defaults to `configs.profile`. Can only be used for
executable projects.

```sh
# Usage
rune run [profile?]

# Runs the default profile
rune run

# Runs a debug profile
rune run debug

# Runs a release profile
rune run release
```

**Scripts**

If you listed a script in your rune.json, you can call it in pre-build or post-build but you can also
directly call it from rune.

```sh
# In your rune.json
# ...
# scripts: {
#   "clean": "py ./scripts/clean.py"
# }
#...

# Usage
rune clean
```
